# Refactor Log - BIDME - 2026-02-05

## 2026-02-05 - Loop 00001 Complete

**Agent:** BIDME
**Project:** BIDME
**Loop:** 00001
**Status:** No PENDING refactors available (no qualifying candidates)

**Summary:**
- Items IMPLEMENTED: 0
- Items WON'T DO: 0
- Items PENDING - MANUAL REVIEW: 0
- Items PENDING but not qualifying (wrong risk/benefit): 1
  - Finding 1 (Env parsing duplication): LOW risk but MEDIUM benefit (requires HIGH or VERY HIGH)

**Recommendation:** Remaining items need manual review or have higher risk/lower benefit than the automation threshold. The single PENDING candidate (env parsing duplication) has MEDIUM benefit — it removes only ~18 lines of small duplication across 6 files and doesn't cause significant maintenance burden. Consider implementing manually if desired.
